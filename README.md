# WebSocket Chat App with Socket.IO

This is a simple chat application built with Node.js and Socket.IO that enables real-time communication between clients using WebSocket technology.

## Description

WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex, low-latency communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. It allows real-time data transfer and enables bidirectional communication between the client and the server, making it ideal for applications that require instant updates and interactive features.

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library that simplifies WebSocket programming by providing an abstraction layer over the WebSocket protocol. It allows developers to build real-time applications easily using event-driven communication between the server and the client.


## Features

- Real-time chat functionality using WebSocket and Socket.IO.
- Instant message delivery and updates without the need for refreshing the page.
